# Color Palette Maker

A simple tool that helps users generate vibrant color palettes using a clever color system (OKLCH) to smoothly transition between a start and end color. This app makes use of Chroma.js, a small JavaScript library for color conversions and color scale generation.

## How to Use

1. Select a start and end hue using the "Hue Start" and "Hue End" sliders and shift the hue range using the "Hue Shift" slider.
2. Adjust the start and end saturation using the "Saturation Start" and "Saturation End" sliders and shift the saturation range using the "Saturation Shift" slider.
3. Adjust the the start and end lightness using the "Lightness Start" and "Lightness End" sliders and shift the lightness range using the "Lightness Shift" slider.
4. Specify the number of color tiles you want in your palette using the "Number of tiles" slider.
5. The color tiles will be generated in real time based on your settings.
6. Each tile will display its contrast level and its hex color code.

## How it's Made

This app is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also utilizes Chroma.js for advanced color manipulation and uses the OKLCH color space.
