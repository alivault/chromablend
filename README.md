# ChromaBlend
## A color palette maker that preserves brightness levels

This is a web-based tool that allows you to generate a hierarchical color palette based on a selected color. It provides both a dark palette and a light palette, ensuring that the colors maintain a hierarchy of brightness. When the lightness slider is set in the middle, the dark palette always works with white text, while the light palette always works with black text.

## How to Use

1. Open the Color Palette Generator in a web browser.
2. Use the color picker input to select a base color for the palette.
3. Adjust the Lightness slider to control the brightness of the palettes.
4. Use the Saturation slider to control the saturation of the base color.
5. The generated color palettes will update in real-time.
6. View the hex code and contrast ratio of each color in the palettes.

## How It's Made

ChromaBlend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages the Chroma.js library for color manipulation and contrast ratio calculations.
